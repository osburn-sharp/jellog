<p>This software is licensed for use under the Open Software Licence v. 3.0
The terms of this licence can be found at <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-3.0.php">www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-3.0.php</a>
and below. Under the terms of this licence, all derivative works must
themselves be licensed under the Open Software Licence v. 3.0</p>

<p>Open Source Initiative OSI - The Open Software Licence 3.0:Licensing</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list label-list"><dt>OSI Approved Licence
<dd>
<p>Open Software Licence (“OSL”) v. 3.0</p>

<p>This Open Software Licence (the “Licence”) applies to any original work
of authorship (the “Original Work”) whose owner (the “Licensor”)
has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice
for the Original Work:</p>

<p>Licensed under the Open Software Licence version 3.0</p>

<p>1) Grant of Copyright Licence. Licensor grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the
copyright, to do the following:</p>

<p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
collective work;</p>

<p>b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
Work, thereby creating derivative works (“Derivative Works”) based upon
the Original Work;</p>

<p>c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under
this Open Software Licence;</p>

<p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p>

<p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p>

<p>2) Grant of Patent Licence. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or
controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as
furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use,
sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and
Derivative Works.</p>

<p>3) Grant of Source Code Licence. The term “Source Code” means the
preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all
available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work.
Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of
the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor
distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by
placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information
repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient
access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original
Work.</p>

<p>4) Exclusions From Licence Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the
names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks
or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except
as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Licence grants any license to
Licensor’s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other
than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the
trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original
Work. Nothing in this Licence shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor
from licensing under terms different from this Licence any Original Work
that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p>

<p>5) External Deployment. The term “External Deployment” means the use,
distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in
any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by
anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated
to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over
a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You
must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a
Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1©.</p>

<p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any
Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark
notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices
of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an
“Attribution Notice.” You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably
calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p>

<p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants
that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to
You under the terms of this Licence with the permission of the
contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly
stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided
under this Licence on an “AS IS” BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this Licence. No
license to the Original Work is granted by this Licence except under this
disclaimer.</p>

<p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
of this Licence or the use of the Original Work including, without
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure
or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law
prohibits such limitation.</p>

<p>9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to
this Licence, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance
of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or
communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make
a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of
recipients to the terms of this Licence. This Licence conditions your
rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your
right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so
without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law
and international treaty. Nothing in this Licence is intended to affect
copyright exceptions and limitations (including “fair use” or “fair
dealing”). This Licence shall terminate immediately and You may no longer
exercise any of the rights granted to You by this Licence upon your failure
to honor the conditions in Section 1©.</p>

<p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This Licence shall terminate
automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to
You by this Licence as of the date You commence an action, including a
cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that
the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not
apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the
Original Work with other software or hardware.</p>

<p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to
this Licence may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business,
and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the
Original Work outside the scope of this Licence or after its termination
shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent
law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the
termination of this Licence.</p>

<p>12) Attorneys’ Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this Licence
or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with such
action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the
termination of this Licence.</p>

<p>13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Licence is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable.</p>

<p>14) Definition of “You” in This Licence. “You” throughout this
Licence, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal
entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of,
this Licence. For legal entities, “You” includes any entity that
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For
purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or
indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

<p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this Licence or by law, and Licensor promises
not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p>

<p>16) Modification of This Licence. This Licence is Copyright © 2005
Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate
this Licence without modification. Nothing in this Licence permits You to
modify this Licence as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works.
However, You may modify the text of this Licence and copy, distribute or
communicate your modified version (the “Modified Licence”) and apply it
to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions:
(i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified Licence is the
“Open Software Licence” or “OSL” and you may not use those names in
the name of your Modified Licence; (ii) You must replace the notice
specified in the first paragraph above with the notice “Licensed under
&lt;insert your license name here&gt;” or with a notice of your own that
is not confusingly similar to the notice in this Licence; and (iii) You may
not claim that your original works are open source software unless your
Modified Licence has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You
comply with its license review and certification process.</p>
